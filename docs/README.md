# Docsify for Technical Documentation

Docsify is a lightweight, JavaScript-based documentation site generator that allows you to create documentation by converting Markdown files into a responsive site.Â 

It's an excellent choice for technical writers who want a simple yet flexible tool without dealing with complex build steps. Docsify renders your documentation on the fly, making updates as simple as changing a Markdown file.

Static sites like Docusaurus and MKDocs require knowledge of React or Python for deeper customization, while sites like Gitbook are easy to use, but the customization options are limited. Docsify gives access to easy setup, full control over customization, and support for free themes and plugins.

## Why Docsify for technical writers?

- Write in Markdown.
- Deploy your site in minutes.
- Customize your site without touching JavaScript(or any language).

This guide will guide you through setting up and using Docsify for technical documentation.
